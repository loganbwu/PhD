# Progress to date

See Powerpoint presentation.

- COVID-19 queueing research
- Modelling based on Routledge

# Upcoming work

- LW + supervisors to design procedure before getting access to data. E.g., what is the minimal dataset?
  - **May be able to access before going to China**
- Considerations:
  - Geographic scale of Vic vs China vs province level
  - Environmental covariates, remote sensing
  - Hainan easier than Yunnan because of island geography
  - Time horizon - perhaps a decade

# UoM/SJTU joint programme

- Need to follow up with international research coordinators

# Actions

- LW to arrange pre-confirmation meeting
- LW to arrange meeting with JMcCaw about Hawkes processes

# Next meeting

- Individually at least every 2 months
- Whole team every 3 months, students to propose discussion topics
