# SJTU status

- Pushback from IRTG on waiving credit
- Ivo has prompted IRTG to promote a higher-level discussion between the two universities

> Dear Logan,
>
> My apologies for the delay in response, but Ivo may have already mentioned to you that according to the SJTU School of Medicine, their credit requirement cannot be waived as you are considered to be considered to be at the same entry level as other direct entry candidates. 
>
> As per your discussions with the SJTU School of Medicine, part of the credits can be transferred to SJTU to count towards their requirements. 
>
> Hope this is acceptable to you, kind regards,
>
> Petra
