# PhD committee

- Ivo to finish WEHI paperwork for 3 month committee meeting

# Ethics

WEHI committee meets Feb 2022 - must use WEHI HREC (rather than DH HREC).

Different approaches to minimise ethics risk. For example:
- No coordinates, DH gives us SA1 with a household flag (maybe salted+hashed addresses)
- Full address with geocoding but we censor and delete the identifiable data

# Writing

## COVID TTIQ

- Consider timing of publication in global context
- Applications in COVID and beyond
- Nick Golding should be good for global context

## COVID diffusion model

- Contrast 2nd wave vs 3rd wave model fitting (extinction vs endemic) - these are generalisable scenarios

# Work Package 4

- No deliverable for LW/EC this week
- In general this is more work for Quantium than us
