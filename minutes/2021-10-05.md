# Reading

Focus on vivax

1. Read Essential Malariology (outdated), David W(?)
2. Advances in Parasitology chapters from vol. mostly 80, little bit of 81 (epidemiology of p. vivax) (2012, 2013)

# Code

1. Get updated code from Eamon for Falciparum first
2. 4 groups of Falciparum models: ICL (ours is in that family), Swiss Tropical Inst. (Open Malaria), Basel (might be more biologically accurate), Intellectual Ventures but renamed (Bill Gates), David Smith. Not worth looking at all of these.
3. These aren't fully spatial and agent based
