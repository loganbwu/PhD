# Process

1. Complete data request form (AF to send) and submit back to AF
2. VicDH Research Request team will reconvene in December at the earliest because of surge - will inform of further actions
3. Complete paperwork on Ethics Review Manager (ERM)
4. Seek ethics approval from any NHMRC-accredited ethics committee - the DH committee tends to be busy. Find one with submission and meeting times that align.
