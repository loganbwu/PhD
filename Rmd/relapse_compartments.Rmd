Investigate what ODE structure would be required for a delayed relapse.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

```{r}
relapse = read_excel("../data/china/Guantang Relapse Data - GJY.xlsx", "Relapse", skip=1) %>%
  mutate_all(as.character) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=matches("relapse"), names_to="event", values_to="delay") %>%
  mutate(delay = as.numeric(delay))

ggplot(relapse, aes(x=delay, fill=event)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=30) +
  facet_wrap(vars(event), ncol=1)

sample_1st = relapse %>%
  filter(event == "1st relapse",
         delay > 100) %>%
  pull(delay)
sample_mean = mean(sample_1st)
sample_var = var(sample_1st)

```

m = a/b
v = a/b^2
v = m/b
b = m/v
a = m*b
a = m^2/v


```{r}
# shape = 50 # number of compartments
shape = sample_mean^2 / sample_var
# rate = 1/2 # rate = 1 / mean time spent in each compartment
rate = sample_mean / sample_var


time = seq(0, 365*2, length.out=1000)
tibble(time=time,
       density = dgamma(time, round(shape), rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=time, y=density)) +
  geom_line()

# n = 1000
# samples = tibble(t1 = rgamma(n, shape, rate),
#                  t2 = rexp(n, 1/10),
#                  t = t1 + t2)
# ggplot(samples, aes(x=t)) +
#   geom_density()
```
